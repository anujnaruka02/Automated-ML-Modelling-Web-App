# Automated-ML-Modelling-Web-App
Data analysis is an integral part of every industry but becomes quite tedious when for different datasets, an individual has to analyse them and infer useful information from them. This is where this web application comes into play. Automated Machine Learning Web Application is a web application that uses the ideas and concept of data analysis and implements them using machine learning models like regression and classifcation. The only effort for the user is to upload the dataset and sit back and relax. 

Dataset used for the process and the pkl file generated has been uploaded.

Process - 
1. This is the home page of the web application

3. Uploading the .csv file. (If you want to use excel file make the relevant changes in app.py where pandas is used to read the CSV file)

4. Profiling report is generated for the given dataset

5. Select the target paramter and then click on train model

6. The model specified in the code gets used for analysing the dataset. (change the model to regression or classification depending upon the kind of dataset being used. pycaret.regression and pycaret.classification respectively)

7. The trained model pipeline cam be downloaded which gives you valuable insights as well.

This is how the web application works.

**NOTE** - 
The web application is still being trained using various datasets for optimising it and making it efficient for processing every kind of information present in a dataset. The required changes will be updated as soom as they are verified and tested.
